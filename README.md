# introduction_to_lang_chain



## Overview
This project demonstrates a versatile, domain-independent AI agent built with **LangChain** and **LangGraph**. It is designed to:

- Maintain and manage conversation history in `file.json` for persistent memory.
- Handle multiple message types (`HumanMessage`, `AIMessage`, `ToolMessage`) using typed agent state.
- Perform a variety of tasks using built-in tools:
  - Reading and saving conversation/document files
  - Creating task plans and breaking them into chunks
  - Generating schedules and task boards
  - Providing the current date and time
- Dynamically update the agent's state and document content while interacting with users.
- Ensure robust error handling and maintain structured document content for AI reasoning.
- 
This  may setup enables creating **interactive, multi-purpose AI assistants** that can adapt to any domain while keeping memory and task management consistent.
